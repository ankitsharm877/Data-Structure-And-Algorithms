##  1. Single Linked List
  * Print all data
  * Count length
  * Create linked list
  * Insert At Beginning
  e. Insert At End
  f. Insert At Middle
  g. Insert At nth Position
  h. Delete From Beginning
  i. Delete From End
  j. Delete From Middle
  K. Delete From nth Position
  
2. Double Linked List
3. Recursion
4. Brute Force approach
5. Backtracking
