# Data-Structure-And-Alogorithm
This project contains algorithms related to data structure and some computational problems like recursion, brute force approach etc.
# List of algorithms:
##  1. Single Linked List
  * Print all data
  * Count length
  * Create linked list
  * Insert At Beginning
  * Insert At End
  * Insert At Middle
  * Insert At nth Position
  * Delete From Beginning
  * Delete From End
  * Delete From Middle
  * Delete From nth Position
  
## 2. Double Linked List
  * Print all data
  * Count length
  * Create linked list
  * Insert At Beginning
  * Insert At End
  * Insert At Middle
  * Insert At nth Position
  * Delete From Beginning
  * Delete From End
  * Delete From Middle
  * Delete From nth Position
  
## 3. Recursion
  * Check array is sorted or not
  * Tower of Hanoi
## 4. Brute Force approach
  * String matching
