Backtracking is an improvement of the brute force approach. It systematically searches for a solution to a problem among 
all available options. In backtracking, we start with one possible option out of many available options and try to solve 
the problem if we are able to solve the problem with the selected move then we will print the solution else we will
backtrack and select some other and try to solve it. If none if the options work out we will claim that there is no
solution for the problem.

Backtracking is a form of recursion.

Example:
1. Binary Strings: generating all binary strings
2. Generating k - ary strings
3. N-Queens problem
4. The Knapsack problem
5. Generalized Strings
6. Hamiltonian Cycles
7. Graph Coloring Problem
