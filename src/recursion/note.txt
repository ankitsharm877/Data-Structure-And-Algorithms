Recursion : Any function which calls itself is called recursion.

Recursive code is generally shorter and easier to rite than iterative code.

//base case
if(test for base case)
	return some base case value
else if (test for another base case)
	return some other base case value

//recursive case
else
	return (some work and then a recursive call)

Example:
1. Fibonacci Series, Factorial Finding
2. Merge Sort, Quick Sort
3. Binary Search
4. Tree Traversals and many Tree Problems: InOrder, PreOrder and PostOrder
5. Graph Traversals: DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search)
6. Dynamic Programming Examples
7. Divide and Conquer Algorithms
8. Towers of Hanoi
